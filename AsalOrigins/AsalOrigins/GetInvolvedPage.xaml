This is reflected in the high volume of current students and those who want to be enrolled. However, our current lack of income, funding or support is proving to have a detrimental effect as we are unable to accommodate all the students participating in our classes. Our resources are currently limited, this has led to the volunteering teachers being unable to provide the best possible aid to the students."
